Everyone says the window of opportunity is only two or three years left. We're going to be replaced, and after we're replaced, where do we go? They say the social mechanism can't withstand this kind of shock, so what can we do?

I'm a student, watching this era change every single day. Big tech companies are frantically releasing AI, proclaiming that white-collar jobs are about to disappear. Thoughtful people worry whether the social system can withstand such massive upheaval. Ordinary people are anxious and confused, while most still haven't felt the change. This world gives me a sense of撕裂.

I've been thinking: What can ordinary people actually do? How can we find our footing in this era of巨变?

Then I thought, maybe there's a path: using the computing power of the lowest-end phone in everyone's hand to piece together a network, allowing truly smart large models to emerge within this network. Small models can already run on phones, but they're too笨; large models are very smart, but only big companies can afford them. If thousands of "little笨 models" in thousands of phones could collaborate, could an intelligence that we ordinary people can also own be born?

There are many problems in between—how do small models communicate with each other? How do they divide labor? How do we prevent someone from causing trouble? We thought of using a local area network neighbor approach, automatically discovering each other within the intranet, and引入 a bit of market mechanism to incentivize contribution. My hypothesis is: these problems might have早就 been solved in nature and human society—ant colonies, neurons, juries, markets... We're just trying to pick up those similar answers, piece them together, and see if we can make a flower bloom.

So, I chatted with Gemini for an evening and generated this white paper (it's in the codebase). Now, I'm writing the Android prototype alone, slowly, but it's moving.

There's also a selfish motive: if this kind of集成式 large model can really be used by big companies, then could they return the money to us ordinary people based on each user's contributed computing power and reputation points? That way, maybe we can have a little more security in this era.

If you've also been troubled by the same questions, or think this direction is a bit interesting, come take a look. Even just telling me "I've thought about it too" would let me know I'm not alone.

(The white paper is in the repository, the code has just been started, and any feedback is welcome.)

Of course, I am still very hopeful. I firmly believe that the future of our country will definitely be good. After all, our computing power foundation is owned by the state, our AI is also the cheapest, and our Party is always above everything else. I believe the future is actually a super-linguistic reality, so I firmly believe that our future will be even better.

This is just a little idea from an individual. If you have any valuable insights, please feel free to join in. Thank you.
